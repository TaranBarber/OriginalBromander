Goals Log:

----5/9/2011----
Threads - 4/5. Need to test out with other cpus
2D Animation - 3/5. need to implement animator for each state.
Interactivity - 2/5. Focusing issues. Keys.
Sounds and Music - 0/5. There are no sounds.
Collision Detection - 3/5. Update this
Path Finding - 0/5 Nothing.
AI - 2/5 because of mccorl
Persistence - 2/5. FIXIT. make toString methods for seriz
Optimization Techniques. - 3/5. Already well optimized because of threading. 
                                Research for any unknown methods for this
Game Design. - 2/5 FIX TILE AND ITEM IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM. MAKE LEVELS

OVERALL 21/50

----5/24/2011----
Threads - 5/5 
2D Animation - 3/5. Need to implement animator for each state.
Interactivity - 4/5. Focusing issues between the View and the ChatBox on the GamePanel
Sounds and Music - 0/5. There are no sounds.
Collision Detection - 5/5.
Path Finding - 3/5. Paths are everywhere where tiles are walkable. 
					The player is still able to walk on unwalkable tiles however.
AI - 4/5. Need to change speeds of AI to make it more realistic
Persistence - 4/5. The Game saves correctly but still need to decide on exactly what to save.
Optimization Techniques. - 5/5. Already well optimized because of threading. 
                                Research for any unknown methods for this
Game Design. - 3/5 Only one level made so far. The editor allows us to make levels now though.

OVERALL 36/50
